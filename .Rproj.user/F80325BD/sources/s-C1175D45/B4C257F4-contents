# Plot Factor
# In datasets that have categorical rather than numeric attributes, we can create bar plots that given an idea of the proportion of instances that belong to each category.

# load the library
library(mlbench)
# load the dataset
data(BreastCancer)
# create a bar plot of each categorical attribute
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
for(i in 2:9) {
	counts <- table(BreastCancer[,i])
	name <- names(BreastCancer)[i]
	barplot(counts, main=name)
}

# We can see that some plots have a good mixed distribution and others show a few labels with the overwhelming number of instances.
