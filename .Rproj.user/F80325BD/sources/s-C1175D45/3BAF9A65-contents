# Plot missing data
# Missing data can have a big impact on modeling. Some techniques ignore missing data, others break. You can use a missing plot to get a quick idea of the amount of missing data in your dataset. The x-axis shows attributes and the y-axis shows instances. Horizontal lines indicate missing data for an instance, vertical blocks represent missing data for an attribute.

# create a missing map
missmap(Soybean, col=c("black", "grey"), legend=FALSE)

# We can see that some instances have a lot of missing data across some or most of the attributes.
