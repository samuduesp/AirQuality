# Correlation Plot
# We can calculate the correlation between each pair of numeric attributes. These pair-wise correlations can be plotted in a correlation matrix to given an idea of which attributes change together.

# load library
library(corrplot)
# load the data
data(iris)
# calculate correlations
correlations <- cor(iris[,1:4])
# create correlation plot
corrplot(correlations, method="circle")

# A dot-representation was used where blue represents positive correlation and red negative. The larger the dot the larger the correlation. We can see that the matrix is symmetrical and that the diagonal attributes are perfectly positively correlated (because it shows the correlation of each attribute with itself). We can see that some of the attributes are highly correlated.
