# Univariate Density Plots
# We can smooth out the histograms to lines using a density plot. These are useful for a more abstract depiction of the distribution of each variable.

# load libraries
library(lattice)
# load dataset
data(iris)
# create a panel of simpler density plots by attribute
par(mfrow=c(1,4))
for(i in 1:4) {
	plot(density(iris[,i]), main=names(iris)[i])
}

#Using the same dataset from the previous example with histograms, we can see the double Gaussian distribution with petal measurements. We can also see a possible exponential (Lapacian-like) distribution for the Sepal width.
